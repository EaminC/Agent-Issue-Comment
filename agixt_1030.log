=== Testing BUGGY Version (Commit: 428e5e0f657ff93bfc931ff5460dc895a6ca4019) ===
--- Running Test for buggy version ---
Found reproduce.py. Executing with python...
TypeError occurred as expected: '>' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'

--- Testing AGiXT Issue #1030 - TypeError: '>' not supported between 'str' and 'int' ---
--- Version: BUGGY ---

Examining the websearch_agent method in Websearch.py

Found lines with websearch_depth comparison:
  if websearch_depth > 0:
  if len(links) > websearch_depth:

Running simulated test for buggy version...

--- Static Code Analysis Results ---
Found bug pattern: Direct comparison of websearch_depth with integer without type conversion
Did not find fix pattern

✅ BUG CONFIRMED: Found code that directly compares string and int
✅ BUG SUCCESSFULLY REPRODUCED: TypeError comparison between 'str' and 'int'

--- Exit code: 0 ---

>>> Running: sudo docker run --rm "alfin06/agentissue-bench:agixt_1030" test_fixed
=== Testing FIXED Version (Commit: 1d0e7708b91cae234f2ae1375c8cd25148a18ab6) ===
--- Running Test for fixed version ---
Found reproduce.py. Executing with python...
Comparison successful

--- Testing AGiXT Issue #1030 - TypeError: '>' not supported between 'str' and 'int' ---
--- Version: FIXED ---

Examining the websearch_agent method in Websearch.py

Found lines with websearch_depth comparison:
  if websearch_depth > 0:
  if len(links) > websearch_depth:

Found type conversion: websearch_depth = int(websearch_depth)

Running simulated test for fixed version...

--- Static Code Analysis Results ---
Did not find bug pattern
Found fix pattern: Type conversion of websearch_depth to int
Fix implementation: websearch_depth = int(websearch_depth)

✅ FIX CONFIRMED: Code now converts websearch_depth to int before comparison
✅ FIX CONFIRMED: No TypeError occurs in the fixed version

--- Exit code: 0 ---
