--- Setting up a test agent with both a standard command and a chain. ---
Adding chain: Test Chain
--- Dummy chain 'my_test_chain' created. ---
--- Agent 'TestAgent' initialized. ---
--- Agent configuration saved. It should include 'Standard Command' and 'my_test_chain'. ---
Reloaded config: {'commands': {'Standard Command': True}}

--- Reloaded agent's enabled commands from the database: ---
['Standard Command']

--- Verifying Bug ---
SUCCESS: The bug is reproduced.
The 'my_test_chain' command was NOT found in the reloaded configuration.
âœ… FIX CONFIRMED: Chain commands now properly save
